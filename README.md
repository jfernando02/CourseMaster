# Course Master

Project Details - Academics and tutorial staff have complex workloads and teaching duties. Often this is managed through a series of spreadsheets maintained by admin staff. This project is to provide a web based application and database that allows the easy administration of academic staff. The web application should be modular and expandable and highly configurable.
